  - title: New Guest Assessments
    content: >
      For dogs who have not yet completed a PawHaus training program, we require
      a one-day assessment before their first boarding stay to ensure comfort,
      compatibility, and a balanced environment for all guests.


      The assessment is a one-time fee of $250, with 50% credited toward your
      first stay. If you’re unable to schedule an assessment prior to boarding,
      a $75 behavioral review surcharge applies to the first visit.
