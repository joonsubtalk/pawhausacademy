introduction:
  content: >
    At **PawHaus Academy**, we believe that dog training is more than teaching
    commands—it’s about fostering understanding, confidence, and balance in
    every dog. Our approach combines structured, real-world training with
    individualized attention, ensuring each dog learns in a way that suits their
    personality, needs, and learning style. From foundational obedience to
    advanced behavioral work, our programs are designed to build not just
    skills, but trust, focus, and a strong bond between dog and owner.
approach:
  - title: Our Vision
    description: >-
      is to create a comprehensive environment where dogs can thrive—physically,
      mentally, and socially—through engaging, purposeful activities. We strive
      to be more than a training facility: PawHaus Academy is a place of
      enrichment, education, and lasting connection, where dogs and their
      families grow together.

  - question: What does my dog need to be a student or resident at PawHaus Academy?
    answer: >-
      We require that all our dogs have up-to-date vaccines for Rabies,
      Bortadella, and DHLPP.


      We also require a one day “Assessment” prior to booking for day training
      and/or boarding. During the assessment, we’ll determine and note your
      dog’s temperament so as to keep them as safe and happy while they are
      staying with us, as well as your goals for day training.
  - question: How do I schedule training for my dog at PawHaus Academy?
    answer: >-
      Please call us at 747.297.2404 or email our Admissions Office at
      admin@pawhausacademy.com – From there we’ll help you setup an initial meet
      and greet and get you setup upon Gingr so that you can book day training
      and boarding stays whenever you and your pup need!
  - question: What does a day at PawHaus Academy look like for my dog?
    answer: >-
      All of our dogs – from our Board & Train students and Day Training
      students, to our Boarding guests, receive some form of activity and
      fulfillment throughout the day.

      A typical day can begin at anywhere between 8:00am and 9:00am. All pups
      will have a mixture of training (mental work), exercise and socialization
      (physical) and of course some fun outdoor (supervised by our Yard Duties)
      for recess in our yard complete with toys, agility course, and friends!
      We’ll also ensure they receive some decompression and rest time midday as
      well but then it’s  ‘lights out’ and rest for the night (with supervision
      by our Resident Directors) by 9:00pm.
  - question: Will I get to see my dog during their Board & Train program?
    answer: >-
      While special arrangements can be made, they are uncommon; however,
      certain circumstances may warrant them. This can be assessed, discussed
      and arranged during your assessment meeting on the day you drop off your
      pup. This session allows the trainer to assess your dog’s temperament and
      discuss any specific requirements or concerns you might have.
  - question: What do I need to bring with my dog when I drop them off?
    answer: >-
      Please be sure to send any medication your pup might need and of course
      their usual food, enough for the length of their stay. Also please update
      your pup’s Gingr profile to ensure we have the most accurate medication
      administration and any specific feeding instructions you’d like us to
      follow. Please also ensure we know if your pup has any allergies so we can
      ensure they are safe and healthy.


      We encourage our pet parents to not send pups with any toys or really
      special items as we would hate for them to get damaged or lost; however,
      if there is a blanket you’d like them to have in their crate or clothing
      you’d prefer for your pup to wear during their stay with us, we understand
      and will be sure to take the best of care of these items.
  - question: >-
      My dog has bitten someone (or me), will you still accept my dog to PawHaus
      Academy?
    answer: >-
      Behavioral cases are taken on a case-by-case basis. We typically reserve a
      few spots in our more intensive Board & Train program for behavioral cases
      as we want to ensure we can give the best time and attention to your pup.


      We would love to discuss this more with you and potentially set up a meet
      and greet/Assessment so that we can better advise you of your options with
      us. Please call our Admissions Office at, 747.287.4327 or email us at,
      admin@pawhausacademy.com.
